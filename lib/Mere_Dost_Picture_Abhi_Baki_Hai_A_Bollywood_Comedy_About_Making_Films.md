Mere Dost Picture Abhi Baki Hai is a film that makes fun of the clichÃ©s and conventions of Bollywood. The film follows the journey of Amar Joshi (Sunil Shetty), who runs a video library in Banaras and dreams of becoming a filmmaker. He sells his video library and joins a film institute in London, where he learns the basics of filmmaking. He then returns to Mumbai, the city of dreams, to make his first film.
 
However, he soon realizes that making a film in Bollywood is not as easy as it seems. He faces various obstacles and challenges, such as finding a producer, a script, a star cast and a crew. He meets Suraj (Rajpal Yadav), a struggling actor who becomes his friend and guide in the industry. He also meets Monty Chadda (Rakesh Bedi), a publicity agent who agrees to produce his film. He convinces Mohini (Udita Goswami), a starlet and her mother Mummyji (Neena Gupta), to act in his film.
 
Amar's film is titled "Yaadon Ki Baaraat", which is a homage to the classic 1973 film of the same name. However, his film turns out to be a disaster, as it is a mishmash of different genres and styles. The film is rejected by the audience and the critics, and Amar faces humiliation and ridicule. He decides to quit filmmaking and return to Banaras. However, he gets a surprise when he learns that his film has become a cult hit among the masses. He realizes that his film has touched the hearts of the people, and that he has achieved his dream of making a film.
