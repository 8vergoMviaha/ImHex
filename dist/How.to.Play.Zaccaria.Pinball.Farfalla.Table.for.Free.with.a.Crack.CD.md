Now that you know how to play Zaccaria Pinball - Farfalla Table for free with a crack CD, you may want to learn some tips and tricks to improve your skills and score. Farfalla is a complex and challenging table that requires good timing, accuracy, and strategy. Here are some of the main features and objectives of the table:

- The main goal of the table is to light all the letters of FARFALLA on the upper playfield. Each letter corresponds to a different task or shot on the table. For example, F is for hitting the four-bank drop targets on the left side, A is for hitting the moving ramp on the right side, R is for hitting the three-bank drop targets on the upper playfield, and so on. Once you light all the letters, you will enter a bonus ball mode, where you have 30 seconds to score as many points as possible.
- The upper playfield has two flippers and four pop bumpers. You can access it by shooting the left orbit or the right ramp. The upper playfield has several targets and features, such as a spinner, a hole, a kickback, and a special flying spot target that moves across the playfield. Hitting this target will light one of the letters of FARFALLA randomly.
- The lower playfield has four flippers and two slingshots. The lower playfield has two ramps, one on each side. The left ramp leads to a hole that awards 1000 points and advances the bonus multiplier. The right ramp leads to a transparent mini-playfield with two flippers and two holes. The left hole awards 5000 points and lights one of the letters of FARFALLA randomly. The right hole awards 10000 points and lights one of the letters of FARFALLA in sequence.
- The table also has two outlane-save flippers that can be activated by pressing both flipper buttons at once. These flippers can save your ball from draining on the outlanes, but they also consume one unit of energy each time you use them. You can replenish your energy by hitting the spinner on the upper playfield.

These are some of the basic tips and tricks to play Zaccaria Pinball - Farfalla Table. There are many more secrets and surprises to discover on this table, so try it out for yourself and see how high you can score!
